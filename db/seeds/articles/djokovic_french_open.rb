  content: "<p>Novak Djokovic made a stunning comeback in the Roland Garros final on Sunday afternoon 
            when he rallied past fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to lift his 
            19th Grand Slam trophy.</p>
            <p>The World No. 1 was in deep trouble as the 22-year-old Tsitsipas played near-flawless 
            tennis in the first two sets, attacking at every opportunity and seizing the moment in his 
            first major championship match. But Djokovic showed incredible resilience to claim his second 
            title at the clay-court major after four hours and 11 minutes.</p>
            <p>This was the sixth time Djokovic has come back from two sets down and the first time he has 
            done it in a Grand Slam final. The top seed battled from two sets down against Lorenzo Musetti 
            in the fourth round, produced a masterclass to eliminate 13-time champion Rafael Nadal in a 
            four-set semi-final, and he completed his fortnight with this thrilling fight-back against 
            Tsitsipas.</p>
            <p>Djokovic joins four other players in the Open Era — Bjorn Borg (1974), Ivan Lendl (1984), 
            Andre Agassi (1999) and Gaston Gaudio (2004) — who have recovered from two sets down in the 
            Roland Garros final. The only player to accomplish the feat at another Grand Slam in the Open 
            Era was Dominic Thiem in last year's US Open final.</p>
            The World No. 1 is now within one major title of his great rivals, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, 
            on the all-time list. He is the first player to win the Career Grand Slam twice in the Open Era. 
            Djokovic is also halfway to the calendar-year Grand Slam.</p>
            <p>It was an impressive turnaround after Tsitsipas sprinted into a dominant position without 
            showing any nerves in his maiden major final. The 22-year-old was in danger of losing the first 
            set when Djokovic served for the set at 6-5, and he faced a set point at 5/6 in the tie-break. 
            But the fifth seed played daring, attacking tennis to take control against the 2016 champion from 
            there. The question was if he would be able to maintain his high level for the entire match.</p>
            <p>The turning point came in the fourth game of the third set. Tsitsipas played courageously to 
            save the first four break points he faced in the game, but he missed a backhand wide on Djokovic's 
            fifth break chance to give the top seed the lead in the set, and he never let slip the momentum.</p>
            <p>Djokovic significantly decreased his unforced errors to force the Greek to close out the final 
            with aggression. But the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals champion was unable to stay on top of the baseline 
            as often as he did in the first two sets. The top seed used his serve to great effect to remain 
            in control of points, and he did not face a break point in the final three sets.</p>
            <p>Djokovic never panicked. He remained composed and used great depth and variety — including plenty 
            of drop shots — to storm to his victory.</p>
            <p>At the start of the match, Tsitsipas locked in after hitting a double fault long on the first 
            point of the match. He earned his first set point in the opener at 5-4, but Djokovic found a way to 
            squeak through a nervous 25-shot rally.</p>
            <p>Despite dropping serve against Djokovic's mounting pressure, Tsitsipas did not relent. He took 
            advantage of the Serbian's dipping first-serve percentage at the end of the set to step into the 
            court and push the World No. 1 around the court. Until that point, the top seed's high first-serve 
            percentage had allowed him to cruise through service games and keep the Greek far behind the baseline, 
            despite one point in which he stumbled while chasing a drop shot and nearly collided with court 
            signage next to the net.</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas crushed 18 winners in the opener and took advantage of a momentary lapse in Djokovic's 
            concentration at the end of the set. Djokovic laced a forehand return down the middle on his set point, 
            but Tsitsipas stayed calm and hit a forehand winner into the open court, eliciting a racquet clap 
            from the top seed.</p>
            <p>When Tsitsipas was able to move closer to the baseline and take big swings, he did well to control 
            play and avoid making too many unforced errors.  The seven-time ATP Tour titlist capitalised on Djokovic's 
            lull in the first game of the second set by breaking immediately when the 34-year-old missed a 
            forehand long. The Serbian missed a forehand in the net later in the set to give the Greek another service 
            break, which was plenty to take a two-set lead.</p>
            <p>The top seed was far sharper in the early stages than he was when he fell behind Nadal 0-5 in the 
            semi-finals. But his missed opportunity to serve out the opener was critical, and his level dipped 
            further to fall behind two sets.</p>
            <p>But Tsitsipas made 11 unforced errors in the third set — compared to 12 for the first two sets combined 
            — to give Djokovic life. The Serbian cut down his mistakes to begin his comeback. And once he converted 
            his fifth break point in the fourth game of the third set, the tone of the clash changed. Suddenly, 
            Tsitsipas was not playing as freely and going after his shots. It settled into a battle of wills from behind 
            the baseline, right where Djokovic wanted it.</p>
            <p>In the fourth set, the Serbian dominated on serve to keep the pressure on the Greek. He lost only three 
            service points in the set. Tsitsipas did not make as many unforced errors, but that was due in large part 
            to the World No. 1 controlling the action. After securing an early break, Djokovic earned a second for 
            security with a perfect drop shot and he closed out the set without an issue to force a decider as shadows 
            crept over Court Philippe-Chatrier.</p>
            <p>Much like he did against Alexander Zverev in the fifth set of their semi-final, Tsitsipas dug out of a 
            service hole in the first game of the decider. This time, however, Djokovic did not let the Greek run away 
            with the momentum.</p>
            <p>At 1-1, Tsitsipas relinquished the deciding service break when he was unable to handle a backhand pickup. 
            The fifth seed held his nerve at 2-4 to avoid going down a double-break, but Djokovic was too dominant on 
            serve for the Greek to find a breakthrough.</p>
            <p>These two clashed in a memorable semi-final on the Parisian clay last year. Djokovic sprinted to a two-set 
            lead, before Tsitsipas mounted a spirited comeback in pursuit of his first major final. The World No. 1 locked 
            down in the decider to advance to the championship match after three hours and 54 minutes.</p>
            <p>Djokovic leads Tsitsipas 6-2 in their ATP Head2Head series and he has won their four clay-court clashes. 
            No other player in the Open Era has completed the Australian Open-Roland Garros double twice, but Djokovic 
            has now done it, as he also won the year’s first two majors in 2016.</p>
            <p>A victory would have made Tsitsipas the youngest major singles champion since 20-year-old Juan Martin del 
            Potro triumphed at the 2009 US Open and the first Greek Grand Slam singles champion. He became the youngest 
            Slam finalist since 22-year-old Andy Murray at the 2010 Australian Open.</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas defeated World No. 2 Daniil Medvedev in the quarter-finals, and he was attempting to become the 
            ninth man in the Open Era to beat both the top two seeds at a major.</p>"
