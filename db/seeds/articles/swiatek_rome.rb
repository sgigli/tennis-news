  content: "<p>Iga Swiatek produced a spellbinding display of tennis to double bagel 
            Karolina Pliskova 6-0 6-0 in just 46 minutes to win the Rome WTA 1000 
            title on Sunday.</p>
            <p>Swiatek dropped just 13 points in total - four in the first set and nine 
            in the second - and faced only four game points against her as she claimed 
            the most one-sided victory in the event, the previous record was set in 1983 
            when Hungary's Andrea Temesvari defeated American Bonnie Gadusek 6-1 6-0.</p>
            <p>Teenager Swiatek, who staved off two match points against Barbora Krejcikova 
            in the third round, will climb five spots to No 10 in the rankings on Monday after 
            sealing her third WTA title following triumphs at Roland Garros and Adelaide.</p>
            <p>\"I am very happy, kind of overwhelmed. Obviously, Karolina had a great run 
            here and in previous years. So congrats,\" said Swiatek, who also thanked 
            her cat.</p>
            <p>\"It's been a tough week but I'm really happy that I got through everything. 
            I was super focused today so I'm really proud of myself. Now I've finally earned 
            some tiramisu.\"</p>
            <p>Blasting winners at will with both her forehand and backhand, Swiatek won 51 
            of the 64 points.</p>
            <p>She led 17-5 in winners and committed only five unforced errors to 
            Pliskova's 23.</p>
            <p>It is only the fourth time since 2000 that a WTA final has ended in a double 
            bagel and is the shortest completed WTA final since Istanbul in 2009 when Vera 
            Dushevina defeated Lucie Hradecka 6-0 6-1 in 41 minutes.</p>
            <p>Pliskova, who was playing in her third consecutive final at the Foro Italico, 
            having won the title in 2019, failed to win a game in a completed match for just 
            the second time in her career.</p>
            <p>\"I think you have days like this in tennis when things are not going your 
            way. I think that was the day today,\" she said.</p>
            <p>The French Open begins on May 30 with Swiatek defending the title she won 
            against Sofia Kenin in October.</p>"
