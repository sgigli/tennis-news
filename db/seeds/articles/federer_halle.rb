  content: "<p>Roger Federer made a good start to his grass-court season on Monday with 
            a 7-6(4), 7-5 win against Ilya Ivashka in the first round of the NOVENTI OPEN.</p>
            <p>“[I] had a tough moment early on in the first set when he had break points, so 
            that was crucial to get out of those,” Federer said in his on-court interview. “And 
            then I played a really good tie-break, which I was happy about. I think as the match 
            went on I started to create more opportunities and started to also calm my nerves 
            a bit.</p>
            <p>“Overall I think I served very well. Clearly, I can always be a little bit better, 
            but I’m very happy and excited that I was able to get through the first one.”</p>
            <p>The Swiss superstar has made clear that he has been building up for this grass-court 
            season. And in his first match on the surface since 2019, Federer did not lose serve 
            and advanced after one hour and 35 minutes, setting a second-round clash against Felix 
            Auger-Aliassime or Hubert Hurkacz.</p>
            <p>\"I missed it. I hadn’t played a tournament [on grass] in two years on this 
            surface,\" Federer said. \"I’ve done the hard courts, I’ve done the clay and now 
            [I am] on the grass. It’s been great being back here in Halle. I love playing here.\"</p>
            <p>This is the 39-year-old’s fourth tournament of the season following a 
            quarter-final showing in Doha, a second-round loss in Geneva and a run to 
            the fourth round at Roland Garros, where he withdrew before playing Matteo 
            Berrettini.</p>
            <p>There was a significant gulf between Federer and Ivashka’s experience on this 
            surface. The Belarusian had previously played four tour-level matches on grass, 
            while the former World No. 1 has won 19 grass-court titles, including 10 in Halle. 
            With his victory, Federer is now 69-7 at this tournament.</p>
            <p>Although Ivashka had not had a lot of grass-court experience, he walked on court 
            Monday with confidence. Not only did he qualify for this tournament, but he pushed 
            Rafael Nadal to three sets in Barcelona and made the semi-finals in Munich.</p>
            <p>The World No. 90 dominated on serve for a large majority of the match and did not 
            face a break point until his 11th service game. Ivashka saved a match point at 4-5 
            in the second set when he barely squeezed a backhand volley into the net. But Federer 
            did not slip a 0/40 advantage in his next return game. On the Swiss’ fourth match point, 
            Ivashka missed a low forehand approach shot into the net for the only break of the match.</p>
            <p>Federer has now won 10 of his past 11 matches at this ATP 500. The 103-time 
            tour-level titlist was not at his flying best, but he was never under threat, winning 77 
            per cent of his first-serve points and saving the two break points he faced.</p>
            <p>\"I’m excited to be back on the green grass,\" Federer said. \"And getting a win 
            is obviously always very nice.</p>
            <p>Federer has advanced to at least the quarter-finals in each of his 17 previous 
            appearances in Halle. The last time he failed to make the semi-finals at this event 
            was in 2001, when he was 19.</p>"
