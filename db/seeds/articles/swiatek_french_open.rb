  content: "<p>Judging by recent evidence, it’s only getting tougher for today’s young players 
            to shoulder that pressure for long periods of time. On the men’s side, the Next Gen 
            continues to labor in the long shadows of the Big 3. On the WTA side, once-budding 
            superstars have wilted into one-Slam wonders. The last 15 women’s majors have had 11 
            different winners.</p>
            <p>Don’t tell any of that to the latest and youngest of those winners, 
            Iga Swiatek.</p>
            <p>The 19-year-old Warsaw native may have buzz-sawed her way through the 2020 
            French Open without dropping a set, but she knows all about the pitfalls of this 
            pitiless sport.</p>
            <p>She’s heard it described as “lonely.” She grew up listening to her father tell 
            her that friendships don’t exist in tennis. She’s watched as tour-mates like 
            Jelena Ostapenko (who also won her first tour-level title at Roland Garros) and 
            Sloane Stephens have failed to follow-up on their Grand Slam breakthroughs, 
            and as others have struggled to cope with the expectations that come with 
            early success.</p>
            <p>Now it’s Swiatek’s turn to cope with those expectations. She’s the first player 
            from her country, and one of the first from her generation—Gen Z—to win a major, 
            but she says she’s ready.</p>
            <p>“When I came back to Poland, my life changed completely,” Swiatek says of her 
            time at home after Roland Garros. “It was really weird, because after a few days 
            I had my own security, which was a totally new thing for me. I went to Warsaw and 
            saw people were recognizing me, and I think I handled it well. I’m comfortable 
            with that attention, and I appreciate it.”</p>
            <p>Rather than a burden she has to face alone, Swiatek sees her success, and 
            the interest it generates, as an opportunity to unite people.</p>
            <p>“I know people like to be divided,” Swiatek says. “Sports is one of those 
            things that can really bring them together, because it’s not about the politics 
            and it’s not about somebody’s opinion. It’s just sports and anybody can cheer.</p>
            <p>“I want people to get together by watching sports. It’s one of my goals 
            to do that.”</p>
            <p>Do these seem like grand plans for a young woman who, as of last spring, 
            was still juggling her practice sessions with her high school math homework? 
            Not to Swiatek. While her ascent may have seemed meteoric to us, it’s something 
            she has been methodically working toward since her early days as a junior. 
            The objective for her wasn’t just to become a major champion; it was to become a 
            reliable champion.</p>
            <p>“My goal has been to be consistent since I was 15,” Swiatek says. “This is 
            what women’s tennis needs. I wish I could be a consistent player right now, 
            but I know I need a few years to do that. My mindset is really good, 
            and that’s not just my opinion.”</p>
            <p>Who shares that opinion? Daria Abramowicz, the Warsaw-based sports psychologist 
            who has been working with Swiatek for two years. Unlike most of her peers, Swiatek’s 
            preparation involves more than bashing balls and doing speed drills—it also involves 
            training her mind.</p>
            <p>This is something of a revolutionary concept in tennis, a sport whose players 
            have traditionally been loath to admit psychological weakness. But Swiatek 
            has embraced the process of delving into her emotions. When she was asked, 
            on the Polish interview show My First Time, what the three most important numbers 
            in her phone were, she said, “My dad, my sister, and right now Daria Abramowicz.”</p>
            <p>“She just made me smarter,” Swiatek said of Abramowicz. “I know more about sports 
            and I know more about psychology, and I can understand my own feelings and say 
            them out loud.”</p>
            <p>Abramowicz has taught Swiatek that you can adjust your attitude in the same 
            way that you can adjust your strokes. Swiatek credits one of those adjustments 
            with helping her find the right approach for Roland Garros.</p>
            <p>“My preseason was so good that I came to New York with really high 
            expectations,” she says of the training she did during the COVID lockdowns 
            before the US Open. “And that was the wrong mindset for matches, because I was 
            thinking about how I can play in practices, and that I’m not using 100 percent 
            of my potential. We worked on that, and I changed that.”</p>
            <p>If Swiatek’s new-school attitude toward psychology is a novelty for tennis, 
            so is her attitude toward the sport’s individualist ethos. To her, the idea 
            that it has to be a solitary pursuit is a myth, as is the idea that the 
            women’s tour is a den of cutthroat combatants.</p>
            <p>“I sank into this world, and it helped me,” Swiatek said of the WTA, 
            on My First Time. “For me, it has always been important to be able to separate 
            friendships from what’s going on on the court. To survive for a long time on 
            tour, you can’t be lonely.”</p>
            <p>“In the beginning, even my dad would say friendships didn’t exist in tennis,” 
            added Swiatek, who often plays doubles and who counts 19-year-old Kaja Juvan of 
            Slovenia as a close friend who has helped her transition from the juniors to 
            the pros. “If you try hard enough and have a positive attitude you can 
            make it work.”</p>
            <p>This isn’t to say that Swiatek doesn’t want to win as much as anyone else 
            who plays a sport for a living. Like Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, Swiatek’s 
            interest in tennis was sparked by her desire to beat her older sister.</p>
            <p>Swiatek’s father, Tomasz, an Olympic rower, wanted his daughters to play 
            an individual sport. After swimming proved to be a bust—“I was scared of water,” 
            Iga says—they settled on tennis. While her sister Agata took lessons, 
            Iga hit against a wall with Tomasz.</p>
            <p>“She’s three years older and I always wanted to be like her,” Swiatek 
            told WTA Insider. “I was always competing with her when I was younger and 
            I always lost, so that was very motivating.”</p>
            <p>Swiatek never got a chance to beat Agata, who stopped playing four years ago. 
            But Iga soon found another idol in Rafael Nadal.</p>
            <p>“I loved how he played because he was different,” she says.</p>
            <p>Maybe watching Rafa rip a topspin forehand rubbed off on Swiatek, who 
            generates plenty of RPMs of her own. The ball seems to leap off her strings.</p>
            <p>“I don’t actually know where that came from,” Swiatek said, “because 
            I always played like huge topspin and I love to spin the ball.”</p>
            <p>The WTA’s elite have noticed, and they can see that the 5’9” Swiatek’s 
            power is going to be a problem.</p>
            <p>“It’s just so different, the way she strikes the ball, I can’t even compare 
            it,” said Osaka, who is friends with Swiatek. “But for me, the most 
            impressive thing I saw was her movement. Like, she’s a crazy-good mover.”</p>
            <p>“She was everywhere and she hit the balls in very strong, very powerful,” 
            Simona Halep said after losing to Swiatek in the Roland Garros round of 16.</p>
            <p>“She’s got a really good forehand, the spinny forehand up the line, 
            really good backhand down the line,” Sofia Kenin said after losing to 
            Swiatek in the final.</p>
            <p>According to Swiatek’s coach, Piotr Sierzputowski, her best quality is 
            the way she shows up on match day.</p>
            <p>“She’s a beast of the competition, I would call her,” he said. “She loves 
            to compete, never likes to practice, it’s boring for her. But when it comes 
            to the matches, she’s there.”</p>
            <p>Swiatek’s most promising quality may be her ability to treat each match 
            as a learning opportunity, and to take her career one step at a time. 
            When she lost 6–1, 6–0 to Halep at Roland Garros in 2019, she didn’t try 
            to put that disaster behind her right away. Instead, Swiatek said, “It’s a 
            good experience for me. I’ll remember that match. I’ll learn from it even 
            though it lasted, like, 40 minutes.”</p>
            <p>Sixteen months later, she showed what she had learned by beating Halep, 
            6–1, 6–2, in under an hour.</p>
            <p>Even for someone who loves the tour, who knows how to control her emotions, 
            and who has a strong support group, the road to the top will have its bumps. 
            Swiatek may be a “crazy-good mover” and have Nadal-like pop, but she has yet 
            to match his ironclad consistency. There’s that word again. It’s what Swiatek 
            has been aiming for since she was 15, and what she’ll aim to bring in 2021.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know what it’s like to be a consistent player,” she says, “but that’s 
            why I have my team. I have to have this distance. I don’t want to put too much 
            pressure on myself.”</p>
            <p>She laughs a little at how daunting the challenge seems, before taking it 
            up again.</p>
            <p>“That doesn’t change that I’m going to be working 100 percent day to day to 
            do it.”</p>
            <p>Swiatek may not believe tennis is a lonely sport, but she knows her future 
            in it lies in her own hands, and her own mind, alone. They seem capable of 
            keeping her at the top of the game for as long as she wants to stay there.</p>"
