  content: "<p>Not since the 2000 edition of the French Open, when Mary Pierce followed 
            her poignant, emotional singles revival by victoriously teaming up with the great 
            Martina Hingis in doubles, had anyone done the double, winning singles and doubles 
            titles at Roland Garros.</p>
            <p>But over the past few days, Barbora Krejcikova has made the feat look easy. 
            One day after a life-changing afternoon in her tennis career when she beat Anastasia 
            Pavlyuchenkova to win a surprise first singles grand slam title, the Czech returned 
            to the same court with her longtime partner, Katerina Siniakova, and they defeated 
            Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-2 in a match between the two most recent 
            singles champions.</p>
            <p>Krejcikova, 25, will now return to No 1 in the doubles rankings and after 
            contesting 15 matches over the past few weeks and spending nearly 22 hours on 
            court, including a quarter-final finish in the mixed doubles, she may now have 
            a rest.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, Krejcikova affirmed she will have to celebrate her double with 
            some champagne, and some time at home, but Wimbledon is already near: “I’m just 
            really looking forward to playing the next tournament and every tournament,” she 
            said. “Right now, after all of this happened these last two weeks, also last days, 
            I just feel really relieved and relaxed.</p>
            <p>“I just know that from now on I can really enjoy it because I have pretty 
            much achieved everything I always wanted. Now I can just improve. That’s the 
            only thing I can do. Just keep improving as all the guys and all the ladies 
            are doing.”</p>
            <p>The comparison between Pierce and Krejcikova underlines the rarity of 
            Krejcikova’s achievement. Pierce herself was a prodigiously talented player 
            who was competing alongside one of the all-time great doubles players in Hingis. 
            Krejcikova is treading a completely opposite route. She was simply returning to 
            the discipline that was her primary source of income, pride and success for so 
            long.</p>
            <p>Krejcikova and Siniakova are unique. Doubles players do not usually reach 
            No 1 at 22 years old, but they were one of the most dominant junior doubles 
            teams in history. They teamed up for the first time at the junior French 
            Open in 2013 simply because they had no one else to play with and they won 
            the whole thing. They went on to win junior Wimbledon and the US Open that 
            year, recording a 24-0 win-loss record in juniors as a team. By 2018 they 
            had reached No 1 on the WTA, winning the French Open and Wimbledon.</p>
            <p>For so much of their time together, Siniakova has been the better singles 
            player. While Krejcikova struggled to break into the top 100, Siniakova easily 
            reached the top 50 in 2016 aged 20, peaking at 31st, and has not left the 
            top 100 since.</p>
            <p>And yet it is Krejcikova who became the sixth consecutive first-time female 
            grand slam champion to be crowned at Roland Garros and the third triumphant 
            unseeded player during this period. She is probably the biggest surprise of 
            all of those surprises but it is also a reminder that chaos rarely comes out 
            of nothing.</p>
            <p>Eight months ago at Roland Garros, she made her debut and reached the 
            fourth round. Since then, she has established herself in the top 100. She 
            reached the final of Dubai, the WTA 1000 tournament, without dropping a 
            set in March.</p>
            <p>In Rome a few weeks ago Krejcikova had Swiatek on the ropes, holding two 
            match points before eventually losing 3-6, 7-6(5), 7-5. Then she won her first 
            title in Strasbourg just before Roland Garros began.</p>
            <p>She arrived in Paris full of confidence in her game and it allowed her game 
            to flow in the good moments, to hold up through the tough ones and to mark her as 
            a grand slam champion in both singles and doubles.
            </p>"
