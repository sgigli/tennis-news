  content: "<p>Third time proved to be the charm for Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Rolex 
            Monte-Carlo Masters on Sunday when he collected his first ATP Masters 1000 
            title with a 6-3, 6-3 victory against Andrey Rublev.</p>
            <p>Appearing in his third final at the level, Tsitsipas dropped just four points 
            behind his first serve (24/28) to capture the second biggest title of his career 
            after 71 minutes. As a result of his final win, the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals champion 
            will climb to first position in the FedEx ATP Race To Turin on Monday. The six-time 
            ATP Tour titlist did not drop a set throughout his week at the Monte-Carlo Country 
            Club.</p>
            <p>“I had an unbelievable week in Monte-Carlo,” Tsitsipas said in his post-match 
            interview. “I can’t describe my feelings right now. I am overwhelmed by so many 
            different emotions and nostalgia. It is incredible that I am able to be in the 
            position that I am. We both deserved to be in the final. We put on an amazing 
            fight and an amazing show… I would consider it as the [best] week of my life so 
            far.”</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas claimed early breaks in each set and dominated on serve to narrow 
            the gap on Rublev at the top of the 2021 wins leaderboard. The Monte-Carlo finalists 
            currently occupy the top two positions on the list and are the only players to have 
            claimed 20 or more victories this season.</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas has taken a 4-3 lead in his fiercely contested ATP Head2Head rivalry 
            with Rublev. The 23-year-old gained revenge for his semi-final loss to the Russian 
            at last month’s ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam. Tsitsipas has won his 
            past two clay-court encounters against Rublev, following his straight-sets quarter-final 
            win at Roland Garros last year.</p>
            <p>“I knew that he was going to be a very difficult opponent to face. There were a lot 
            of nerves coming into that match. [We] always want to bring the best out of [ourselves] 
            when facing each other. Playing Andrey was a very difficult thing to do today, also 
            considering that it was a final. There is extra stress and extra importance in the 
            match that we had to play. [I am] definitely proud of the way I managed to behave and 
            be out on the court today.</p>
            <p>“The clay court season couldn’t have started better,” Tsitsipas said. “It is the 
            best thing winning my first Masters 1000 and it is even more special doing it here 
            on home soil in Monte-Carlo and doing it on clay, which is my favourite surface.”</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas made a fast start on Court Rainier III. The Athens native pinned Rublev 
            into his backhand corner to earn his first break point of the match at 1-0 and switched 
            tactics with a backhand up the line to claim the only break of the set. Tsitsipas dropped 
            just two points across his next four service games (16/18) to move one set from 
            victory.</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas showcased a mix of power and precision on his backhand and found 
            consistent depth on his forehand return to break for the second time at 1-1 in 
            the second set. The World No. 5 continued his fine serving performance to reach 
            match point, when he broke Rublev for the third time. Tsitsipas sunk to his knees 
            in celebration after Rublev fired a cross-court backhand into the tramline.</p>
            <p>Rublev was also chasing his first Masters 1000 trophy and the top spot in the 
            FedEx ATP Race To Turin. The World No. 8 defeated Top 10 seeds Roberto Bautista 
            Agut and 11-time champion Rafael Nadal in back-to-back three-set matches en route 
            to his first Masters 1000 final.</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas is not the first member of his family to triumph at the Monte-Carlo 
            Country Club. His mother, Julia Salnikova, won a junior title at the venue in 1981.</p>"
