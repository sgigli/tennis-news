  content: "<p>Rafael Nadal saved one championship point on Sunday to defeat 
            Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-7(6), 7-5 and collect a record-extending 12th 
            Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell trophy.</p>
            <p>The top seed was one point from defeat at 4-5, 30/40 in the decider 
            and he carried the momentum from that moment to win three straight games 
            and overcome the Monte-Carlo champion after three hours and 38 minutes. The 
            championship match was the longest best-of-three-set ATP Tour final since 
            statistics started being tracked in 1991.</p>
            <p>This is the second tournament where Nadal has captured 12 or more titles. 
            The 13-time Roland Garros champion, who failed to convert two championship 
            points at 5-4 in the second set, will return to No. 2 in the FedEx ATP Rankings 
            on Monday.</p>
            <p>\"I think I never played a final like this in this tournament, so 
            it means a lot to me against a player like him, [after what] he achieved 
            in Monte-Carlo and [that he reached] the final here without losing a set,\" 
            Nadal said. \"It is an important victory for me. I think I have been increasing 
            my level during the whole week and this victory confirms it. That's important for 
            today.</p>
            <p>\"To have the trophy with me here at home means a lot, but at the same time 
            for the future.\" </p>
            <p>For the first time, Nadal has lifted the Barcelona title after dropping 
            more than one set (3). The 34-year-old, who also needed three sets in 
            his opening two matches, raised his game as the tournament progressed and 
            fought hard to get past Tsitsipas, who entered his second Barcelona final 
            (0-2) with a 9-0 match record (17-0 sets) on clay in 2021.</p>
            <p>\"It's about accepting the challenge,\" Nadal said. \"It is about being humble 
            enough to accept that sometimes you are not playing that well and you need to 
            fight for it and you need to try to find solutions every day. That's what I did.\"</p>
            <p>The five-time year-end World No. 1 gained revenge for his loss to the Greek 
            in the Australian Open quarter-finals this February. On that occasion, 
            Tsitsipas joined Fabio Fognini and Roger Federer as only the third man to beat 
            Nadal from two sets down. </p>
            <p>Nadal extends his ATP Head2Head advantage against Tsitsipas to 7-2. The 
            20-time Grand Slam champion also beat Tsitsipas in the 2018 final in Barcelona, 
            where Tsitsipas made his debut in an ATP Tour championship match. This was 
            only the third final meeting between Top 5 players in tournament history.</p>
            <p>Nadal also improved his unbeaten record to 12-0 in Barcelona finals. 
            The Mallorcan now owns an Open Era record 61 tour-level trophies on clay, 
            placing him 12 titles clear of second-placed Guillermo Vilas (49).</p>
            <p>\"For me, the simple fact of being able to play in Barcelona after last year's 
            tournament wasn't held means a lot to me,\" Nadal told the crowd during the trophy 
            ceremony. \"After almost a year of not being able to experience playing in front 
            of a crowd, these are incredible feelings. I really appreciate the love and 
            support you all have shown me throughout my career. Playing in my club and in 
            front of fans means a lot.\"</p>
            <p>Nadal found himself under consistent pressure on serve in the first set 
            with Tsitsipas stepping inside the baseline to take short balls early and 
            force his opponent into defensive positions. The top seed was able to find 
            big serves and powerful forehands under pressure to save five of the six break 
            points he faced and he won four consecutive games from 2-4 to become the first 
            player to take a set off Tsitsipas this year on clay.</p>
            <p>Nadal once again recovered from a break down in the second set and earned 
            two championship points on Tsitsipas’ serve at 5-4. The 2019 Nitto ATP Finals 
            champion charged the net to stay alive and rallied from 2/4 in the tie-break to 
            force a decider. Tsitsipas defended well in the tie-break, introduced drop shots 
            to break up play and benefitted from a Nadal double fault at 6/6 to prolong his 
            hopes of a maiden Barcelona trophy.</p>
            <p>In a tight third set, Nadal was forced to save the first break point — a 
            championship point — at 4-5. The Spaniard clipped the net with a defensive 
            backhand early in the rally and he drove a forehand up the line to remain in 
            contention. Nadal piled the pressure on his opponent in the next game and 
            extracted back-to-back errors with depth on his returns. Nadal clinched the 
            title on his third championship point when Tsitsipas narrowly missed the target 
            on his forehand. Nadal fell to the clay and roared in celebration.</p>
            <p>Tsitsipas, who leads the FedEx ATP Race To Turin, was aiming to lift his 
            maiden ATP 500 trophy. The 22-year-old claimed his first ATP Masters 1000 title 
            last week at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters and tied Andrey Rublev’s Tour-leading 
            mark of 26 wins this season by reaching the Barcelona championship match.</p>"
